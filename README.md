1. Clone the repository into an appropriate local development environment. Refer to this [Homestead set-up guide](https://github.com/caldonovan/Laravel-Homestead-Setup) if you're unsure.
2. In your terminal, navigate to the project folder and type ``composer install``.
2. After composer is finished, type ``npm install``.
